In A1, I implement BP to train MLP to classify the given dataset

In A2, I design a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks to approximate the mapping; And design a Kohonen self organizing map (SOM) to cluster colors

In A3, I design a small convolutional network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset, create a Recurrent Neural Network to predict the next day opening price using the past 3 days Open, High, and Low prices and volume, and create a network to classify the review as positive or negative (Sentiment Analysis).

In A4, I create a fuzzy inferencing system to decide the Speed and Steering.
